Since June 30, 2020, openLooKeng has been growing with everyone's attention. Those glittering moments are the sparks of community friends.
 
In 2021, prior to its 1st anniversary, openLooKeng becomes one of the first open source communities to earn the Trusted Open Source Community certification. It is one of the best gifts the community has received. As the community grows quickly, the openLooKeng has presented itself as a powerful big data engine.

The openLooKeng open source community has more than 30 partners, including China Merchants Bank (CMB), China Everbright Bank (CEB), AsiaInfo Technologies, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China Mobile, and China Unicom. They have brought contributions to key features of openLooKeng. The community also works closely with industry solution software partners to jointly launch scenario-specific solutions. For example, with openLooKeng, Beiming Software launched their Data Asset Management Platform v4.0 to offer data exchange and sharing services, and Legion Technology introduced the UIAUTO, a data asset management platform.
