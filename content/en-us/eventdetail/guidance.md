### Introduction


By default, our website doesn't have single content page for each event, but if you wanna share further information, feel free to put it here and link this page to the event banner.

Simply create a markdown file under this 'eventdetail' folder, write additional information (like agenda, speaker info, and more) here. Then go back to the 'events' folder, find the corresponding event there, enter the relative path of this markdown file to a field called "link" in front matter.
